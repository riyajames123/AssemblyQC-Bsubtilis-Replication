# üß¨ AssemblyQC Replication ‚Äì *Bacillus subtilis*

This project documents the reproduction of the AssemblyQC pipeline using the *Bacillus subtilis* genome as part of a class assignment for BINF6310 at Northeastern University.

AssemblyQC is a Nextflow-based pipeline that evaluates genome assembly quality using tools like Assemblathon2, BUSCO, LAI, and NCBI FCS-GX. This reproduction was executed on the Discovery HPC cluster using Singularity.

## üìÑ Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Raw genome files are not included due to file size.
- BUSCO failed under Singularity; this was a known issue. Other modules ran successfully.
- Only the configuration file was modified; no changes were made to the pipeline code.
